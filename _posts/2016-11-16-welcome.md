Welcome to my blog!

I'll mostly talk about my ongoing adventure with [YAHTR](https://github.com/fp12/yahtr), a game in Python using the [Kivy Framework](https://kivy.org) for the GUI.


The main idea with YAHTR is that:

* I want to learn new things
* I want to experiment with hexagons
* I want to have fun!


I already have a few topics in mind for the first posts:

* Threading game simulation while Kivy animates stuff
* Building an ingame console (Kivy + Python logging module)
* Cythonizing your process or memory heavy code
* And maybe some utils I use...


Let's do this! :)
