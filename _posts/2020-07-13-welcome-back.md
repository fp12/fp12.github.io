Welcome **back** to my blog!
<!--more-->

I know... You probably never went to the first iteration of this blog. I can't blame you: I didn't share it and I kept it secret until, well... I simply forgot about it. :)

Now, it turns out that I have quite a few topics in mind that I want to share. So I decided it was a good time to dust off this blog and start sharing... again.  

On the short term (next few weeks), I would like to cover the [Unreal Fest Online](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/events/unreal-fest-online-2020) and give my feedback on the conferences I'm interested in:  

**Games** track:
* Unreal Engine for Next-Gen Games
* Optimizing and Building UI for AAA Games
* Harnessing the Unreal Engine Automation Framework for Performance Measurement
* The Evolution of Real-Time VFX with Unreal Engine's Niagara
* Make it Fast: Simultaneous AI Actions in Gears Tactics
* Benefits and Pitfalls of Using Gameplay Abilities Framework
* Speeding up Game Logic in Unreal Engine  
* Building Worlds in Fortnite With Unreal Engine

**Cross-industry** track:
* Diving Into Niagara: Intelligent Particle Effects
* How to Use Blender with Unreal Engine
* Collect, Analyze, and Visualize Your Data with Unreal Insights
* Building Advanced Effects in Niagara with Unreal Engine
* Applying for an Epic MegaGrant: Make Your Submission Stand Out

And that's already quite a lot! I think I'll slowly release my feedback on a few videos at once.

For the longer term, I'll probably cover other conferences but I also want to share more "personal" content: a few experiments in C++, some quick tips in Unreal, and even some more high level programming thoughts.
* Different flavors of [range for](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/range-for), applied in Unreal Engine 4
* Meta programming in C++17
* Dithering for UMG in Unreal Engine 4
* Call-site context in C++
* Maybe, maybe... the part #2 from [Building an ingame console]({% post_url 2016-11-19-building-an-ingame-console-part-1 %})... :)

That's all for now!  
If you have any suggestions, or topics you want me to cover, feel free to reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fpoupineau)! That's where I'm active, and I'll promote most of my posts there first (maybe sometimes on Reddit, if I dare...).

Thanks!  
Fabien.
